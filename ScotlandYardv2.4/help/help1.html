<h2>The Scene</h2>

Mr X, the most wanted criminal, is on the run in Central London 
and Scotland Yard's finest detectives are in a hot pursuit. To 
escape capture, Mr. X must move cleverly and secretly (Mr X.'s 
whereabouts are revealed only as many as 5 times during the 
game); to corner Mr X, the detectives must use ingenuity and 
cooperation.

One player(in the game,computer) is Mr X. All other players 
are the detectives(which in the game are controlled by a 
human player). Whether one is being chased or doing the 
chasing, all players travel from location to location by 
bus, taxi or underground. To take a certain form of 
transportation, you must be on the correct spot and have the 
correct fare - no ticket, no ride!
<br><br>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
You will be controlling the detectives and so one of the 
detectives must capture Mr X. by landing on the same space 
Mr X occupies.
