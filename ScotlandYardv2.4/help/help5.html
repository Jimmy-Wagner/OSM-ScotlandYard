<h2>Turn sequence</h2>
<h3>FOR THE DETECTIVES</h3>
In the game, Mr. X <i>plays the first move</i>. As a player, you will be controlling five detectives. Here is how you make a move
<ul>
<li>Select a possible move from the choice box. The choice box shows all the available moves of the detective along with the transportation ticket required. After selecting a move,click the button "done".
<li>Repeat this for the rest of the detectives.
</ul>
After the detectives move Mr X. makes its move and its move is shown in a separate window box.
<br><br>
As a detective, your ticket supply diminishes as you play and it is possible that you could be <i>stranded</i> at a location without any tickets at all or without the particular ticket you need to move from and to another location. If this happens, the detective is virtually out of the game but it remains there on the stop, on its stranded location and neither Mr. X nor the detectives can go to that stop.
<br>
<h3>FOR Mr. X</h3>
Mr. X moves after all the detectives have moved. However, Mr. X moves are not always known to the detectives. Mr X. will reveal the ticket it has used to move to the new location but it will reveal its positions only at the moves 3, 8, 13, 18, 23.
