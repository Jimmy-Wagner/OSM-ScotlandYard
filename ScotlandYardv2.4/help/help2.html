<h2>The Set-Up</h2>
When you run the game, you will initially see a map on the
screen. Click the button "Start Game" to start the game. When
you do so, the game is loaded and you will see the Mr X. move
in a separate window. The various controls in the game are
discussed else where.
<br>
<h2>The fare tickets</h2>
Initially,each of the detectives has the following tickets
<br>10 TAXI
<br>8 BUS
<br>4 UNDERGROUND
<br>
A detective's ticket supply is <i>limited</i>. Once a ride is
taken and the ticket has been used, that ticket is
"spent". There is no way for a detective to replenish these
used tickets.
