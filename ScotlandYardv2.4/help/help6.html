<h2>The end of the game</h2>
The game is over if any of the following occur:
<ul>
<li>If any detective moves onto a numbered location that Mr. 
X occupies, Mr. X is captured and the game is over. Mr. X has 
lost the game and the Scotland Yard detective team is the 
winner.
<li>If none of the detectives can move because they have run 
out of fare tickets, then Mr. X wins the game and the 
detectives lose the game! This can only happen after every 
detective makes its 22nd move and Mr. X is still not caught.
<li>If none of the detectives can move because they run out 
of a particular kind of a ticket, then Mr. X wins the game 
and the detectives lose the game. This is a remote situation 
but it is possible that all the detectives could be left 
with only bus or underground tickets and be stranded on 
locations that do not use such tickets!
</ul>
<br>
IMPORTANT: After the game is over, the previous positions of 
Mr. X and detectives are displayed so that you can see where 
you missed Mr. X(or rather, Mr. X missed you!).
